# Project Title:
To predict the heart attack disease for organization WHO,using machine learning algorithm rate of heart attack disease will increasing manner or decreasing manner
# Porblem Statement
A WHO estimated 12 million death records.One of them half off the death result is found in US.The research intenders the researchers scholar pointout the most relevant risk factor of heartattack As a datascience engineer predict the overall risk using machine learning alogorithm which is called as logistic regression 
# Task1: 
Import the libery which is required for prediction
# Task2: 
Import the dataset your using workspace
# Task3: 
Use a appropriate argument of sklearn libery to train,test and split the dataset 
# Task4: 
Fit your values with a arrange function using future scaling
# Task5: 
Check your model accuracy and precission using confusion matrix

# Conclusion:
According to the model analysis the logistic regression algorithm works successfully with 0.6 accuracy.The accuracy shows that building the model is successfull.
